# Correlation Analysis Between Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Life Expectancy

## Project Overview
This project investigates the potential correlation between global greenhouse gas emissions and life expectancy over the past two decades. By leveraging independently collected datasets, the analysis aims to uncover interactions among variables such as GDP, population size, and emissions, while avoiding causal inferences.

## Dataset
Source: Publicly available greenhouse gas emissions and life expectancy datasets (e.g., World Bank, WHO)
Time Period: 2000 â€“ 2020
Frequency: Annual data

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
- Merged independently collected datasets on emissions, life expectancy, GDP, and population size
- Handled missing values and normalized data for consistent analysis
2. Correlation Analysis
- Calculated Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots and heatmaps
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined trends over time for each variable
- Evaluated potential confounding factors such as GDP and population growth

## Results
The analysis revealed a weak correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and life expectancy globally. Stronger interactions were observed with GDP and population size, suggesting that economic development and demographic factors play more significant roles in influencing life expectancy.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate regional and country-specific analyses to identify localized trends
- Introduce more sophisticated statistical models to account for confounding variables
- Utilize machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on multiple factors
